# Deprecation Notice

# Networking and Kafka on Docker

When running Kafka under Docker, you need to pay careful attention to your configuration of hosts and ports to enable components both internal and external to the docker network to communicate. You can see more details in [this article](https://rmoff.net/2018/08/02/kafka-listeners-explained/).
