Image Design Overview
---------------------

In this section we assume some prior knowledge of Docker and of how to write Dockerfiles.  If you'd like to first  on best practices for writing Dockerfiles, we recommend reviewing `Docker's best practices guide <https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#best-practices-for-writing-dockerfiles>`_.

The Bootup Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon startup, the entrypoint ``/etc/confluent/docker/run`` runs three executable scripts found in
the ``/etc/confluent/docker``.  They are run in the following sequence:

``/etc/confluent/docker/configure``

``/etc/confluent/docker/ensure``

``/etc/confluent/docker/launch``

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``configure`` script does all the necessary configuration for each image. This includes the following:

- Creating all configuration files and copying them to their proper location
- Ensuring that mandatory configuration properties are present
- Handling service discovery (if required)

Preflight Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ensure`` scripts makes sure that all the prerequisites for
launching the service are in place. This includes:

-  Ensure the configuration files are present and readable.
-  Ensure that you can write/read to the data directory. The directories
   need to be world writable.
-  Ensuring supporting services are in READY state. For example, ensure
   that ZK is ready before launching a Kafka broker.
-  Ensure supporting systems are configured properly. For example, make
   sure all topics required for C3 are created with proper replication,
   security and partition settings.

Launching the Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``launch`` script runs the actual process. The script should ensure
that :

-  The process is run with process id 1. Your script should use ``exec`` so the program takes over the shell process rather than running as a child process.  This is so that your program will receive signals like SIGTERM directly rather than its parent shell process receiving them.
-  Log to stdout

Development Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We adhered to the following guidelines when developing these Docker bootup scripts:

1. Make it Executable
2. Fail Fast
3. Fail with Good Error Messages
4. Return 0 if success, 1 if fail

.. _setup :

Setup
-----

1. Install Docker.  Here we assume you are running on macOS.  For instructions on installing Docker on Linux or Windows, please refer to the official `Docker Machine documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       brew install docker docker-machine

2. Create a Docker Machine:

  .. codewithvars:: bash

      docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 6000 confluent

  This command will create a local environment but it is recommended that you create one on AWS. The builds are much faster and more predictable (virtualbox stops when you close the lid of the laptop and sometimes gets into a weird state).  When choosing an instance type, ``m4.large`` is good choice. It has 2 vCPUs with 8GB RAM and costs around ~$88 monthly.

  .. codewithvars:: bash

      export INSTANCE_NAME=$USER-docker-machine
      docker-machine create \
         --driver amazonec2 \
         --amazonec2-region us-west-2 \
         --amazonec2-instance-type m4.large \
         --amazonec2-root-size 100 \
         --amazonec2-ami ami-16b1a077 \
         --amazonec2-tags Name,$INSTANCE_NAME \
         $USER-aws-confluent

3. Configure your terminal window to attach it to your new Docker Machine:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       eval $(docker-machine env confluent)

.. _building_the_images :

Building the Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started, you can build all the |cp| images as follows:

  .. codewithvars:: bash

    make build-debian

You can run build tests by running ``make test-build``.  Use this when you want to test the builds with a clean slate.  This deletes all images and starts from scratch.

.. _running_tests :

Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need to first install virtualenv: ``pip install virtualenv``

  .. codewithvars:: bash

      cd cp-docker-images
      make test-zookeeper
      make test-kafka

To run a single test, you can do so with Python.  In the following example, we run only the ``ConfigTest`` found in ``test_zookeeper.py``:

  .. codewithvars:: bash

    venv/bin/py.test tests/test_zookeeper.py::ConfigTest -v

  .. note::

    Deleting All Docker Containers: During the development process, you'll often need to delete and rebuild the Docker images.  You can do so by running ``docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)``.


Make Targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete all images tagged with ``label=io.confluent.docker.testing=true`` :

``clean-images``

Delete all containers tagged with ``label=io.confluent.docker.build.number`` :

``clean-containers``

Tag images for the repository in ``DOCKER_REMOTE_REPOSITORY``:

``tag-remote``

Push images to the private repository:

``push-private``

Push to the Docker hub:

``push-public``

.. _extending_images:

Extending the Docker Images
---------------------------

You may want to extend the images to add new software, change the
config management, use service discovery etc.  This page provides instructions for doing so.

.. _prerequisites :

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Read the section on :ref:`development <development>` to setup the development environment to build Docker images.
#. Understand how the images are structured by reading the following docs:

   -  ``image-structure`` describes the structure of the images
   -  ``utility_scripts`` describes the utility scripts used in the
      images

#. If you plan to contribute back to the project, see the `contributing guidelines <https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-docker-images/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

.. _adding_connectors_to_images :

Adding Connectors to the Kafka Connect Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Confluent provides two images for Kafka Connect:

    - The Kafka Connect Base image contains Kafka Connect and all of its dependencies. When started, it will run the Connect framework in distributed mode.
    - The Kafka Connect image extends the Kafka Connect Base image and includes several of the connectors supported by Confluent: JDBC, Elasticsearch, HDFS, S3, and JMS.

There are currently two ways to add new connectors to these images.

* Build a new Docker image that has the new connectors installed. You can follow examples 1 or 3 in the documentation below.
* Use the `cp-kafka-connect` or `cp-kafka-connect-base` image as-is and :ref:`add the connector JARs via volumes <external_volumes>`.

.. _examples :

Examples
~~~~~~~~

The following examples show to extend the images.

#.  Add connectors from `Confluent Hub <http://confluent.io/hub>`_

    This example shows how to use the
    :ref:`Confluent Hub client <confluent_hub_client>` to create a
    Docker image that extends from one of Confluent's Kafka Connect images but which contains a custom
    set of connectors. This may be useful if you'd like to use a connector that isn't contained in the
    ``cp-kafka-connect`` image, or if you'd like to keep the custom image lightweight and not include
    any connectors that you don't plan to use.
    
    #.  Choose an image to extend:

        Functionally, the ``cp-kafka-connect`` and ``cp-kafka-connect-base`` images are identical;
        the only difference is that the former image already contains several of Confluent's
        connectors, whereas the latter comes with none by default. This example will extend from the
        ``cp-kafka-connect-base`` image.
    
    #. Choose the connectors from Confluent Hub that you'd like to include in your custom image.

        This example will create a custom image with only the MongoDB, Microsoft's Azure IoT Hub,
        and Google BigQuery connectors.
    
    #.  Write a Dockerfile:
    
        .. sourcecode:: bash
    
            FROM confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect-base:5.0.0
            
            RUN   confluent-hub install --no-prompt hpgrahsl/kafka-connect-mongodb:1.1.0 \
               && confluent-hub install --no-prompt microsoft/kafka-connect-iothub:0.6 \
               && confluent-hub install --no-prompt wepay/kafka-connect-bigquery:1.1.0

    #.  Build the Dockerfile:

        .. sourcecode:: bash
          
            docker build . -t my-custom-image:1.0.0

        The output from that command should resemble:
    
        .. sourcecode:: bash
              
            Step 1/2 : FROM confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect-base
             ---> e0d92da57dc3
            ...
            Running in a "--no-prompt" mode 
            Implicit acceptance of the license below:
            Apache 2.0 
            https://github.com/wepay/kafka-connect-bigquery/blob/master/LICENSE.md 
            Implicit confirmation of the question: You are about to install 'kafka-connect-bigquery' from WePay, as published on Confluent Hub. 
            Downloading component BigQuery Sink Connector 1.1.0, provided by WePay from Confluent Hub and installing into /usr/share/confluent-hub-components 
            Adding installation directory to plugin path in the following files: 
              /etc/kafka/connect-distributed.properties 
              /etc/kafka/connect-standalone.properties 
              /etc/schema-registry/connect-avro-distributed.properties 
              /etc/schema-registry/connect-avro-standalone.properties 
         
            Completed 
            Removing intermediate container 48d4506b8a83
             ---> 496befc3d3f7
            Successfully built 496befc3d3f7
            Successfully tagged my-custom-image:1.0.0

    This will result in an image named ``my-custom-image`` that contains the MongoDB, IoT Hub, and
    BigQuery connectors, and which will be capable of running any/all all of them via the Kafka
    Connect framework.

#.  Download configuration from a URL

    This example shows how to change the configuration management. You will need to override the ``configure`` script to download the scripts from an HTTP URL.

    To do this for the |zk| image, you will need the following dockerfile and configure script. This example assumes that each property file is has a URL.

    ``Dockerfile``

    .. sourcecode:: bash
      
        FROM confluentinc/cp-zookeeper

        COPY include/etc/confluent/docker/configure /etc/confluent/docker/configure

    ``include/etc/confluent/docker/configure``

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        . /etc/confluent/docker/bash-config
        
        # Ensure that URL locations are available.
        dub ensure ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_CONFIG_URL
        dub ensure ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_ID_URL
        dub ensure ZOOKEEPER_LOG_CONFIG_URL
        
        # Ensure that the config location is writable.
        dub path /etc/kafka/ writable
        
        curl -XGET ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_CONFIG_URL > /etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties
        curl -XGET ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_ID_URL > /var/lib/zookeeper/data/myid
        curl -XGET ZOOKEEPER_LOG_CONFIG_URL > /etc/kafka/log4j.properties
        
        Build the image:
        
            docker build -t foo/zookeeper:latest .

    Run it :

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        docker run \
             -e ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_CONFIG_URL=http://foo.com/zk1/server.properties \
             -e ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_ID_URL =http://foo.com/zk1/myid \
             -e ZOOKEEPER_LOG_CONFIG_URL =http://foo.com/zk1/log4j.properties \
             foo/zookeeper:latest

#.  Add More Software

    This example shows how to add new software to an image. For example, you might want to extend the Kafka Connect client to include the MySQL JDBC driver. If this approach is used to add new connectors to an image, the connector JARs must be on the ``plugin.path`` or the classpath for the Connect framework.

    ``Dockerfile``

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        FROM confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect
        
        ENV MYSQL_DRIVER_VERSION 5.1.39
        
        RUN curl -k -SL "https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-${MYSQL_DRIVER_VERSION}.tar.gz" \
            | tar -xzf - -C /usr/share/java/kafka/ --strip-components=1 mysql-connector-java-5.1.39/mysql-connector-java-${MYSQL_DRIVER_VERSION}-bin.jar
            Build the image:
    
    .. sourcecode:: bash
    
        docker build -t foo/mysql-connect:latest .

    **This approach can also be used to create images with your own Kafka Connect Plugins.**

#.  Logging to volumes

    The images only expose volumes for data and security configuration. But you might want to write to external storage for some use cases. For example: You might want to write the Kafka authorizer logs to a volume for auditing.

    ``Dockerfile``

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        FROM confluentinc/cp-kafka
        
        # Make sure the log directory is world-writable
        RUN echo "===> Creating authorizer logs dir ..." \
             && mkdir -p /var/log/kafka-auth-logs
             && chmod -R ag+w /var/log/kafka-auth-logs
        
        VOLUME ["/var/lib/${COMPONENT}/data", "/etc/${COMPONENT}/secrets", "/var/log/kafka-auth-logs"]
        
        COPY include/etc/confluent/log4j.properties.template /etc/confluent/log4j.properties.template

    ``include/etc/confluent/log4j.properties.template``

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        log4j.rootLogger={{ env["KAFKA_LOG4J_ROOT_LOGLEVEL"] | default('INFO') }}, stdout
        
        log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
        log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
        log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=[%d] %p %m (%c)%n
        
        log4j.appender.authorizerAppender=org.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppender
        log4j.appender.authorizerAppender.DatePattern='.'yyyy-MM-dd-HH
        log4j.appender.authorizerAppender.File=/var/log/kafka-auth-logs/kafka-authorizer.log
        log4j.appender.authorizerAppender.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
        log4j.appender.authorizerAppender.layout.ConversionPattern=[%d] %p %m (%c)%n
        
        log4j.additivity.kafka.authorizer.logger=false
        
        {% set loggers = {
         'kafka': 'INFO',
         'kafka.network.RequestChannel$': 'WARN',
         'kafka.producer.async.DefaultEventHandler': 'DEBUG',
         'kafka.request.logger': 'WARN',
         'kafka.controller': 'TRACE',
         'kafka.log.LogCleaner': 'INFO',
         'state.change.logger': 'TRACE',
         'kafka.authorizer.logger': 'WARN, authorizerAppender'
         } -%}
        
        
        {% if env['KAFKA_LOG4J_LOGGERS'] %}
        {% set loggers = parse_log4j_loggers(env['KAFKA_LOG4J_LOGGERS'], loggers) %}
        {% endif %}

    Build the image:

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        docker build -t foo/kafka-auditable:latest .

#.  Writing heap and verbose GC logging to external volumes

    You might want to log heap dumps and GC logs to an external volumes for debugging for the Kafka image.

    ``Dockerfile``

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        FROM confluentinc/cp-kafka
        
        # Make sure the jvm log directory is world-writable
        RUN echo "===> Creating jvm logs dir ..." \
             && mkdir -p /var/log/jvm-logs
             && chmod -R ag+w /var/log/jvm-logs
        
        VOLUME ["/var/lib/${COMPONENT}/data", "/etc/${COMPONENT}/secrets", "/var/log/jvm-logs"]

    Build the image:

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        docker build -t foo/kafka-verbose-jvm:latest .

    Run it:

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        docker run \
            -e KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx256M -Xloggc:/var/log/jvm-logs/verbose-gc.log -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/var/log/jvm-logs" \
            foo/kafka-verbose-jvm:latest

#.  External Service discovery

    You can extend the images to support for any service discovery mechanism either by overriding relevent properties or by overriding the ``configure`` script as explained in example 1.

    The images support Mesos by overriding relevent proprties for Mesos service discovery. See ``debian/kafka-connect/includes/etc/confluent/docker/mesos-overrides`` for examples.

    .. _oracle_jdk :

#.  Use Oracle JDK

    The images ship with Azul Zulu OpenJDK.  Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot bundle Oracle JDK, but we are testing on Zulu OpenJDK and do suggest it as a viable alternative.  In the event that you really need to use Oracle's version, you can follow the steps below to modify the images to include Oracle JDK instead of Zulu OpenJDK.

    #.  Change the base image to install Oracle JDK instead of Zulu OpenJDK by updating ``debian/base/Dockerfile``.
    
        .. sourcecode:: bash

    #.  Next, rebuild all the images:
    
        .. sourcecode:: bash
        
            make build-debian

.. _utility_scripts :

Utility Scripts
---------------

Given the dependencies between the various |cp| components (e.g. ZK required for Kafka, Kafka and ZK required for Schema Registry, etc.), it is sometimes necessary to be able to check the status of different services.  The following utilities are used during the bootup sequence of the images and in the testing framework.

    positional arguments:
      host  Hostname for Schema Registry.
      port     Port for Schema Registry.
      timeout   Time in secs to wait for service to be ready.

3. kr-ready

  Used for checking if the REST Proxy is ready.  If you have multiple REST Proxy nodes, you may need to check their availability individually.

  .. codewithvars:: bash

    usage: cub kr-ready [-h] host port timeout

    positional arguments:
      host  Hostname for REST Proxy.
      port     Port for REST Proxy.
      timeout         Time in secs to wait for service to be ready.


Client Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following properties may be configured when using the ``kafka-ready`` utility described above.

``bootstrap.servers``
  A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping&mdash;this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form <code>host1:port1,host2:port2,...</code>. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).

  * Type: list
  * Default:
  * Importance: high

``ssl.key.password``
  The password of the private key in the key store file. This is optional for client.

  * Type: password
  * Importance: high

``ssl.keystore.location``
  The location of the key store file. This is optional for client and can be used for two-way authentication for client.

  * Type: string
  * Importance: high

``ssl.keystore.password``
  The store password for the key store file.This is optional for client and only needed if ssl.keystore.location is configured.

  * Type: password
  * Importance: high

``ssl.truststore.location``
  The location of the trust store file.

  * Type: string
  * Importance: high

``ssl.truststore.password``
  The password for the trust store file.

  * Type: password
  * Importance: high

``sasl.kerberos.service.name``
  The Kerberos principal name that Kafka runs as. This can be defined either in Kafka's JAAS config or in Kafka's config.

  * Type: string
  * Importance: medium

``sasl.mechanism``
  SASL mechanism used for client connections. This may be any mechanism for which a security provider is available. GSSAPI is the default mechanism.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "GSSAPI"
  * Importance: medium

``security.protocol``
  Protocol used to communicate with brokers. Valid values are: PLAINTEXT, SSL, SASL_PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "PLAINTEXT"
  * Importance: medium

``ssl.enabled.protocols``
  The list of protocols enabled for SSL connections.

  * Type: list
  * Default: [TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1, TLSv1]
  * Importance: medium

``ssl.keystore.type``
  The file format of the key store file. This is optional for client.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "JKS"
  * Importance: medium

``ssl.protocol``
  The SSL protocol used to generate the SSLContext. Default setting is TLS, which is fine for most cases. Allowed values in recent JVMs are TLS, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2. SSL, SSLv2 and SSLv3 may be supported in older JVMs, but their usage is discouraged due to known security vulnerabilities.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "TLS"
  * Importance: medium

``ssl.provider``
  The name of the security provider used for SSL connections. Default value is the default security provider of the JVM.

  * Type: string
  * Importance: medium

  The file format of the trust store file.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "JKS"
  * Importance: medium

``sasl.kerberos.kinit.cmd``

  * Type: string
  * Default: "/usr/bin/kinit"
  * Importance: low

``sasl.kerberos.min.time.before.relogin``
  Login thread sleep time between refresh attempts.

  * Type: long
  * Default: 60000
  * Importance: low

``sasl.kerberos.ticket.renew.jitter``
  Percentage of random jitter added to the renewal time.

  * Type: double
  * Default: 0.05
  * Importance: low

``sasl.kerberos.ticket.renew.window.factor``
  Login thread will sleep until the specified window factor of time from last refresh to ticket's expiry has been reached, at which time it will try to renew the ticket.

  * Type: double
  * Default: 0.8
  * Importance: low

``ssl.cipher.suites``

  * Importance: low

``ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm``
  The endpoint identification algorithm to validate server hostname using server certificate.

  * Type: string
  * Importance: low

``ssl.keymanager.algorithm``
  The algorithm used by key manager factory for SSL connections. Default value is the key manager factory algorithm configured for the Java Virtual Machine.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "SunX509"
  * Importance: low
