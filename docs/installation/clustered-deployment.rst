.. _clustered_quickstart:

Clustered Deployment on Docker
==============================

This tutorial runs a three-node Kafka cluster and |zk| ensemble.  By the end of this tutorial, you will have successfully installed and run a simple deployment with Docker.

It is worth noting that we will be configuring Kafka and |zk| to store data locally in the Docker containers.  For production deployments (or generally whenever you care about not losing data), you should use mounted volumes for persisting data in the event that a container stops running or is restarted.  This is important when running a system like Kafka on Docker, as it relies heavily on the filesystem for storing and caching messages. For an example of how to add mounted volumes to the host machine, see the :ref:`documentation on Docker external volumes <external_volumes>`.

Installing and Running Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this tutorial, we'll run Docker using the Docker client.  If you are interested in information on using Docker Compose to run the images, :ref:`skip to the bottom of this guide <clustered_quickstart_compose>`.

To get started, you'll need to first `install Docker and get it running <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_.  The |cp| Docker Images require Docker version 1.11 or greater.


.. _docker-setup-3-node:

Docker Client: Setting Up a Three Node Kafka Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're running on Windows or macOS, you'll need to use `Docker Machine <https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/>`_ to start the Docker host.  Docker runs natively on Linux, so the Docker host will be your local machine if you go that route.  If you are running on Mac or Windows, be sure to allocate at least 4 GB of ram to the Docker Machine.

Now that we have all of the Docker dependencies installed, we can create a Docker machine and begin starting up |cp|.

.. note:: In the following steps we'll be running each Docker container in detached mode.  However, we'll also demonstrate
          how access the logs for a running container.  If you prefer to run the containers in the foreground, you can do
          so by replacing the ``-d`` flags with ``-it``.

#. Create and configure the Docker machine.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 6000 confluent

   Next, configure your terminal window to attach it to your new Docker Machine:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        eval $(docker-machine env confluent)

#. Start Up a 3-node |zk| Ensemble

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        docker run -d \
           --net=host \
           --name=zk-1 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_ID=1 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT=22181 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME=2000 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_INIT_LIMIT=5 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_SYNC_LIMIT=2 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_SERVERS="localhost:22888:23888;localhost:32888:33888;localhost:42888:43888" \
           confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:|release|

        docker run -d \
           --net=host \
           --name=zk-2 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_ID=2 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT=32181 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME=2000 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_INIT_LIMIT=5 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_SYNC_LIMIT=2 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_SERVERS="localhost:22888:23888;localhost:32888:33888;localhost:42888:43888" \
           confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:|release|

        docker run -d \
           --net=host \
           --name=zk-3 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_ID=3 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT=42181 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME=2000 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_INIT_LIMIT=5 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_SYNC_LIMIT=2 \
           -e ZOOKEEPER_SERVERS="localhost:22888:23888;localhost:32888:33888;localhost:42888:43888" \
           confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:|release|

   Before moving on, you can check the logs to see the broker has booted up successfully by running the following command:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        docker logs zk-1

   You should see messages like this at the end of the log output:

   ::

         [2016-07-24 07:17:50,960] INFO Created server with tickTime 2000 minSessionTimeout 4000 maxSessionTimeout 40000 datadir /var/lib/zookeeper/log/version-2 snapdir /var/lib/zookeeper/data/version-2 (org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperServer)

   You can repeat the command for the two other |zk| nodes.  Next, you should verify that ZK ensemble is ready:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        for i in 22181 32181 42181; do
          docker run --net=host --rm confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:|release| bash -c "echo stat | nc localhost $i | grep Mode"
        done

   You should see one ``leader`` and two ``follower`` nodes.  The output should look something like the following:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        Mode: follower
        Mode: leader
        Mode: follower

#. Now that |zk| is up and running, we can fire up a three node Kafka cluster.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        docker run -d \
            --net=host \
            --name=kafka-1 \
            -e KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=localhost:22181,localhost:32181,localhost:42181 \
            -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://localhost:29092 \
            confluentinc/cp-kafka:|release|

        docker run -d \
            --net=host \
            --name=kafka-2 \
            -e KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=localhost:22181,localhost:32181,localhost:42181 \
            -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://localhost:39092 \
            confluentinc/cp-kafka:|release|

         docker run -d \
             --net=host \
             --name=kafka-3 \
             -e KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=localhost:22181,localhost:32181,localhost:42181 \
             -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://localhost:49092 \
             confluentinc/cp-kafka:|release|

   Check the logs to see the broker has booted up successfully

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        docker logs kafka-1
        docker logs kafka-2
        docker logs kafka-3

   You should see start see bootup messages. For example, ``docker logs kafka-3 | grep started`` will show the following:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

          [2016-07-24 07:29:20,258] INFO [Kafka Server 1003], started (kafka.server.KafkaServer)
          [2016-07-24 07:29:20,258] INFO [Kafka Server 1003], started (kafka.server.KafkaServer)

   You should see the messages like the following on the broker acting as controller.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        [2016-07-24 07:29:20,283] TRACE Controller 1001 epoch 1 received response {error_code=0} for a request sent to broker localhost:29092 (id: 1001 rack: null) (state.change.logger)
        [2016-07-24 07:29:20,283] TRACE Controller 1001 epoch 1 received response {error_code=0} for a request sent to broker localhost:29092 (id: 1001 rack: null) (state.change.logger)
        [2016-07-24 07:29:20,286] INFO [Controller-1001-to-broker-1003-send-thread], Starting  (kafka.controller.RequestSendThread)
        [2016-07-24 07:29:20,286] INFO [Controller-1001-to-broker-1003-send-thread], Starting  (kafka.controller.RequestSendThread)
        [2016-07-24 07:29:20,286] INFO [Controller-1001-to-broker-1003-send-thread], Starting  (kafka.controller.RequestSendThread)

#. Test that the broker is working as expected.

   Now that the brokers are up, you can test that they're working as expected by creating a topic.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

      docker run \
        --net=host \
        --rm \
        confluentinc/cp-kafka:|release| \
        kafka-topics --create --topic bar --partitions 3 --replication-factor 3 --if-not-exists --zookeeper localhost:32181

   You should see the following output:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        Created topic "bar".

   Now verify that the topic is created successfully by describing the topic.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

      docker run \
          --net=host \
          --rm \
          confluentinc/cp-kafka:|release| \
          kafka-topics --describe --topic bar --zookeeper localhost:32181

   You should see the following message in your terminal window:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       Topic:bar   PartitionCount:3    ReplicationFactor:3 Configs:
       Topic: bar  Partition: 0    Leader: 1003    Replicas: 1003,1002,1001    Isr: 1003,1002,1001
       Topic: bar  Partition: 1    Leader: 1001    Replicas: 1001,1003,1002    Isr: 1001,1003,1002
       Topic: bar  Partition: 2    Leader: 1002    Replicas: 1002,1001,1003    Isr: 1002,1001,1003

   Next, you will generate some data to the ``bar`` topic that was just created.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        docker run \
          --net=host \
          --rm confluentinc/cp-kafka:|release| \
          bash -c "seq 42 | kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:29092 --topic bar && echo 'Produced 42 messages.'"

   The command above will pass 42 integers using the Console Producer that is shipped with Kafka.  As a result, you should see something like this in your terminal:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

      Produced 42 messages.

   It looked like things were successfully written, but let's try reading the messages back using the Console Consumer and make sure they're all accounted for.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        docker run \
         --net=host \
         --rm \
         confluentinc/cp-kafka:|release| \
         kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:29092 --topic bar --from-beginning --max-messages 42

   You should see the following (it might take some time for this command to return data. Kafka has to create the ``__consumers_offset``
   topic behind the scenes when you consume data for the first time and this may take some time):

   .. codewithvars:: bash

      1
      4
      7
      10
      13
      16
      ....
      41
      Processed a total of 42 messages

Docker Compose: Setting Up a Three Node Kafka Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you get started, you will first need to install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_ and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_.  Once you've done that, you can follow the steps below to start up the |cp| services.

#. Clone the |cp| Docker Images Github Repository.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-docker-images

   This repo contains an example Docker Compose file that will start up |zk| and Kafka.  Navigate to ``cp-docker-images/examples/kafka-cluster``, where it is located:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

        cd cp-docker-images/examples/kafka-cluster

#. Start |zk| and Kafka using Docker Compose ``up`` command.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       docker-compose up

   In another terminal window, go to the same directory (kafka-cluster).  Before we move on, let's make sure the services are up and running:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       docker-compose ps

   You should see the following:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

              Name                       Command            State   Ports
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------
       kafkacluster_kafka-1_1       /etc/confluent/docker/run   Up
       kafkacluster_kafka-2_1       /etc/confluent/docker/run   Up
       kafkacluster_kafka-3_1       /etc/confluent/docker/run   Up
       kafkacluster_zookeeper-1_1   /etc/confluent/docker/run   Up
       kafkacluster_zookeeper-2_1   /etc/confluent/docker/run   Up
       kafkacluster_zookeeper-3_1   /etc/confluent/docker/run   Up

   Check the |zk| logs to verify that |zk| is healthy. For
   example, for service zookeeper-1:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       docker-compose logs zookeeper-1

   You should see messages like the following:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       zookeeper-1_1  | [2016-07-25 04:58:12,901] INFO Created server with tickTime 2000 minSessionTimeout 4000 maxSessionTimeout 40000 datadir /var/lib/zookeeper/log/version-2 snapdir /var/lib/zookeeper/data/version-2 (org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperServer)
       zookeeper-1_1  | [2016-07-25 04:58:12,902] INFO FOLLOWING - LEADER ELECTION TOOK - 235 (org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Learner)

   Verify that ZK ensemble is ready:

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       for i in 22181 32181 42181; do
          docker run --net=host --rm confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:|release| bash -c "echo stat | nc localhost $i | grep Mode"
       done

   You should see one ``leader`` and two ``follower``

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       Mode: follower
       Mode: leader
       Mode: follower

   Check the logs to see the broker has booted up successfully.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       docker-compose logs kafka-1
       docker-compose logs kafka-2
       docker-compose logs kafka-3

   You should see start see bootup messages. For example, ``docker-compose logs kafka-3 | grep started`` shows the following

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       kafka-3_1      | [2016-07-25 04:58:15,189] INFO [Kafka Server 3], started (kafka.server.KafkaServer)
       kafka-3_1      | [2016-07-25 04:58:15,189] INFO [Kafka Server 3], started (kafka.server.KafkaServer)

   You should see the messages like the following on the broker acting as controller.

   .. codewithvars:: bash

       kafka-3_1      | [2016-07-25 04:58:15,369] INFO [Controller-3-to-broker-2-send-thread], Controller 3 connected to localhost:29092 (id: 2 rack: null) for sending state change requests (kafka.controller.RequestSendThread)
       kafka-3_1      | [2016-07-25 04:58:15,369] INFO [Controller-3-to-broker-2-send-thread], Controller 3 connected to localhost:29092 (id: 2 rack: null) for sending state change requests (kafka.controller.RequestSendThread)
       kafka-3_1      | [2016-07-25 04:58:15,369] INFO [Controller-3-to-broker-1-send-thread], Controller 3 connected to localhost:19092 (id: 1 rack: null) for sending state change requests (kafka.controller.RequestSendThread)
       kafka-3_1      | [2016-07-25 04:58:15,369] INFO [Controller-3-to-broker-1-send-thread], Controller 3 connected to localhost:19092 (id: 1 rack: null) for sending state change requests (kafka.controller.RequestSendThread)

   .. tip:: ``docker-compose logs | grep controller`` makes it easy to grep through logs for all services.

#. Follow step 4 in :ref:`docker-setup-3-node` section above to test that your brokers are functioning as expected.
