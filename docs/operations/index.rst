Docker Operations
=================

In this section, we provide a closer look at how to run a |cp| cluster on Docker.  If you are looking for a simple tutorial, you should refer instead to the :ref:`quick start guide <quickstart>`.

We will cover the following topics:

- Monitoring: How to set up monitoring with JMX, as well as recommendations for extending the images to use other monitoring solutions.
- Logging: Using log4j in a Docker setup.
- Networking: Bridge and host networking (including caveats for each)
- Mounting External Volumes: This is important when running Kafka Brokers and |zk| on Docker, as they require a persistent filesystem.
